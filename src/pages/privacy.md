### <a name="infocollect"></a>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO I COLLECT?

**Personal information you disclose to me**

_In Short:_ I collect personal information that you provide to me.

I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to me when you express an interest in obtaining information about me or my products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact me.

**Personal Information Provided by You.** The personal information that I collect depends on the context of your interactions with me and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information I collect may include the following:

- email addresses
- job titles
- names

**Sensitive Information.** I do not process sensitive information.

All personal information that you provide to me must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify me of any changes to such personal information.

**Information automatically collected**

_In Short:_ Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit my Services.

I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use my Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of my Services, and for my internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in my Cookie Notice: [pjmartorell.dev/cookies](https://pjmartorell.dev/cookies).

The information I collect includes:

- _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information my servers automatically collect when you access or use my Services and which I record in log files. Depending on how you interact with me, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).
- _Device Data._ I collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
- _Location Data._ I collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information I collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, I may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells me your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing me to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

### <a name="infouse"></a>2. HOW DO I PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

_In Short:_ I process your information to provide, improve, and administer my Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. I may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

**I process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with my Services, including:**

- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** I may process your information to provide you with the requested service.
- **To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.** I may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the requested service.
- **To enable user-to-user communications.** I may process your information if you choose to use any of my offerings that allow for communication with another user.
- **To send you marketing and promotional communications.** I may process the personal information you send to me for my marketing purposes, if this is in accordance with your marketing preferences. You can opt out of my marketing emails at any time. For more information, see "[WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?](#privacyrights)" below.
- **To save or protect an individual's vital interest.** I may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.

### <a name="legalbases"></a>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

_In Short:_ I only process your personal information when I believe it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill my legitimate business interests.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require me to explain the valid legal bases I rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, I may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

- **Consent.** I may process your information if you have given me permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about [withdrawing your consent](#withdrawconsent).
- **Performance of a Contract.** I may process your personal information when I believe it is necessary to fulfill my contractual obligations to you, including providing my Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
- **Legitimate Interests.** I may process your information when I believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve my legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, I may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
  - Send users information about special offers and discounts on my products and services
- **Legal Obligations.** I may process your information where I believe it is necessary for compliance with my legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend my legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which I am involved.
- **Vital Interests.** I may process your information where I believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

### <a name="whoshare"></a>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

_In Short:_ I may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.

**Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.** I may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("**third parties**") who perform services for me or on my behalf and require access to such information to do that work. I have contracts in place with my third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless I have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from me. They also commit to protect the data they hold on my behalf and to retain it for the period I instruct.

The categories of third parties I may share personal information with are as follows:

- Performance Monitoring Tools
- Payment Processors
- Ad Networks
- AI Platforms
- Social Networks
- Communication & Collaboration Tools

I also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers.** I may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of my business to another company.
- **Other Users.** When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions, or other content to the Services) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Services in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within my Services, and view your profile.

### <a name="cookies"></a>5. DO I USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

_In Short:_ I may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

I may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with my Services. Some online tracking technologies help me maintain the security of my Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.

I also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on my Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on my Services or on other websites.

Specific information about how I use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in my Cookie Notice: [pjmartorell.dev/cookies](https://pjmartorell.dev/cookies).

**Google Analytics**

I may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze the use of the Services. The Google Analytics Advertising Features that I may use include: Google Analytics Demographics and Interests Reporting. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). You can opt out of Google Analytics Advertising Features through [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/) and Ad Settings for mobile apps. Other opt out means include [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice](http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice). For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the [Google Privacy & Terms page](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### <a name="inforetain"></a>6. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

_In Short:_ I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.

I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### <a name="infosafe"></a>7. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

_In Short:_ I aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from my Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

### <a name="infominors"></a>8. DO I COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

_In Short:_ I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

I do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do I knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If I learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, I will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from my records. If you become aware of any data I may have collected from children under age 18, please contact me via [pjmartorell.dev/contact](https://pjmartorell.dev/contact)

### <a name="privacyrights"></a>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

_In Short:_ In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below.

I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe I am unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your [Member State data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

**Withdrawing your consent:** If I am relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from my marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that I send, or by contacting me using the details provided in the section "[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](#contact)" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, I may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of my Services. For further information, please see my Cookie Notice: [pjmartorell.dev/cookies](https://pjmartorell.dev/cookies).

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email me via [pjmartorell.dev/contact](https://pjmartorell.dev/contact)

**10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

### <a name="policyupdates"></a>11. DO I MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

_In Short:_ Yes, I will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

I may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If I make material changes to this Privacy Notice, I may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. I encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how I am protecting your information.
